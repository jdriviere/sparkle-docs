# Sparkle Documentation
### v0.1.0
The official Sparkle.CSS framework documentation.

### __Sections__
In this repository, you will find all elements in the Sparkle framework in their respective folders. The folders are as followed:
- Components
- Forms
- Layouts
- Utilities

You can also have a sneak-peek preview of what certain elements look like by going to the __assets__ folder, and clicking on the images, or you can visit the [__official website__](https://sparklecss.herokuapp.com).

### __Contributing__
All the elements are well documented, as much as possible. But improvements can always be added. If you find a way to further improve this documentation, please setup a __Pull Request__, and let us know!

Thank you again for using Sparkle. :smile:
