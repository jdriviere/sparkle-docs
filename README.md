You can also have a sneak-peek preview of what certain elements look like by going to the [__assets__](https://github.com/sparkle-css/sparkle-docs/tree/master/docs/assets) folder, and clicking on the images, or you can visit the [__official website__](https://sparklecss.herokuapp.com).

All the elements are well documented, as much as possible. But improvements can always be added. If you find a way to further improve this documentation, please setup a [__Pull Request__](https://github.com/sparkle-css/sparkle-docs/pulls), and let us know!

Thank you again for using Sparkle. :smile:
